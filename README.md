Scratch Holograms are an interesting effect. 
Circle archs of different radii create the illusion of 
an illumination source to origin from different locations 
behind (or in front) of the plane.
There are multiple interesting videos on youtube and also some 
publications on this topic. 
This here is just a simple implementation (the actual ideal 
form would not correspond to an arch), but the distortion that 
origins from this is not a major issue for the outcome. In this 
script, the notebook takes an stl file, allows to align the model 
and divide it into individual points. These points are then resembled
by one individual arch.
The image created by this process is supposed to be read by a laser 
cutter into plastic sheets.
This has not yet been tested, but it should work :D
